# Business Directory Backend - Project Overview

## Project Overview

This is a Node.js-based backend for a business directory application that enables users to register businesses, search for businesses by category, and rate/review businesses. The project uses Express.js for the API framework and PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for data management.

## Architecture & Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 
- **ORM**: Prisma
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **File Upload**: Built-in handling for business photos and profile pictures
- **Email**: Nodemailer for password reset functionality

## Key Features

1. **User Management**
   - Registration with profile pictures
   - Authentication using JWT
   - Profile management (update/delete)
   - Password reset functionality

2. **Business Management**
   - Business registration with categorization
   - Business profiles with details like opening hours, location, contact info
   - Support for business photos, banners, and profile pictures
   - Category and subcategory organization

3. **Social Features**
   - Ratings and reviews for businesses
   - Favorites/bookmarking functionality
   - Comments on business listings

4. **Search and Discovery**
   - Search businesses by name, location
   - Filter businesses by category
   - Location-based features (latitude/longitude)

## Database Schema

The database is well-structured with proper relationships between entities:

- **User**: Stores user information and authentication details
- **Business**: Central entity with relationships to owners, categories, and features
- **Category/Subcategory**: Hierarchical organization of businesses
- **Ratings/Comments/Favorites**: Social interaction models
- **Photos/SocialMediaLinks**: Additional business information

## Code Structure

The codebase follows a standard MVC-like pattern:
- **Routes**: Define API endpoints
- **Controllers**: Implement business logic
- **Middleware**: Handle authentication and request processing
- **Models**: Defined via Prisma schema

## Strengths

1. **Well-organized code structure** with clear separation of concerns
2. **Comprehensive data model** that captures the complexity of a business directory
3. **Strong authentication system** with password validation and JWT tokens
4. **Flexible search functionality** for discovering businesses
5. **File upload handling** for business imagery

## Areas for Potential Improvement

1. **Error handling** could be more consistent across controllers
2. **Input validation** is present but could be more robust or use a validation library
3. **Test coverage** appears limited based on the directory structure
4. **Documentation** is available in the README but could be expanded for API endpoints

## Recommendations

1. **Implement comprehensive testing**: Add unit and integration tests for all endpoints
2. **Add API documentation**: Consider using Swagger/OpenAPI for interactive documentation
3. **Enhance validation**: Add more robust validation, possibly using a library like Joi or express-validator
4. **Consider rate limiting**: Add protection against abuse for endpoints like login
5. **Implement refresh tokens**: For better security alongside access tokens
